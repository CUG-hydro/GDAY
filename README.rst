GDAY model
=============================================

GDAY (Generic Decomposition And Yield) is a simple, daily time step ecosystem model that represents carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics at the stand scale. The model is coded entirely in C without any dependancies. The wrapper files
for the example scripts and the script used to change GDAY parameter options,
are written in python. The old python version is still `online <https://github.com/mdekauwe/pygday>`.

Installation
=============
There is a Makefile in the src directory... ::

    $ make clean ; make 


I haven't done anything about an installation directory so you will need to move
the executable yourself.

Running the model
=================
A simple model usage can be displayed by calling GDAY as follows ::

    $ gday -u
