# GDAY model

GDAY (Generic Decomposition And Yield) is a simple ecosystem model that represents carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics at the stand scale. The model can be run at either a daily time step, or sub-daily (i.e. 30-minutes). When the model is run at the sub-daily timescale, photosynthesis is calculated using a two-leaf approximation, otherwise photosynthesis is calculated following Sands (1995,1996). The sub-daily approach (photosynthesis & leaf energy balance) mirrors [MAESTRA](http://maespa.github.io/manual.html), without the complexity of the radiation treatment.

## Dependancies
The model is coded entirely in C without any dependancies. The wrapper files
for the example scripts and the script used to change GDAY parameter options,
are written in python. The old python version is still [online](https://github.com/mdekauwe/pygday).

## Installation
There is a Makefile in the src directory...

```bash
$ make clean ; make
```

I haven't done anything about an installation directory so you will need to move
the executable yourself.

## Running the model
A simple model usage can be displayed by calling GDAY as follows ::

```bash
$ gday -u
```

Alternative to run GDAY:

```bash
$ gday -p param_file.cfg
```
